# Biomedical Image Analysis

This repository hosts a hobby project centered around biomedical image analysis, created while learning Python and utilizing Jupyter Notebooks. The project aims to explore the world of medical imaging, understand image processing techniques, and extract valuable insights from biomedical images.

## Project Overview

The project delves into the following aspects:

- **Biomedical Images:** Examining various types of biomedical images, such as X-rays, MRIs, or microscopy images.
- **Image Processing Techniques:** Implementing image processing algorithms and techniques to enhance, segment, or extract information from the images.
- **Insights and Analysis:** Exploring patterns, features, or anomalies in the images that could aid medical professionals in diagnostics or research.

## Project Structure

The project in the Jupyter Notebook is structured as follows:

- **Image Processing:** Implementing image processing algorithms or filters for tasks like noise reduction, edge detection, or segmentation.
- **Feature Extraction:** Extracting meaningful features or patterns from the images for further analysis.
- **Insights and Visualization:** Presenting insights or findings from image analysis, potentially aiding medical professionals.
